# Day 9

I thought part 1 was easy so I tried to breeze through it but not only did my code not work I misread the problem so I keep doing this every year and not learning my lesson.

Part 2 was tricky only because I forgot to filter out points I had already visited so I kept overcounting. I didn't score well but it was my own fault.
