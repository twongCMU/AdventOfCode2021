# Day 7

Another good problem. The first part was trivial and I was done very quickly. Unfortunately that wasn't good enough since a few hundred people also found the problem simple!

Part 2 stumped me mostly because I forgot the formula for summing increasing integers. I ended up writing a for loop to compute the sum every time which was very slow. The code went from 50 seconds to .3 seconds when I switched to a formula but I had already submitted a correct answer by then.
