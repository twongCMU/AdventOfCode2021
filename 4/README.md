# Day 4

This was a nice puzzle. I don't remember having a bingo board before. 

I feel like I've gotten a lot better at coding compared to last year. I got part 1 with minimal debugging even though it was not
a trivial puzzle. I got stuck on part 2 because I assumed that each callout would only trigger bingo on at most one bingo card
which is obviously false. Aside from that I'm not spending a lot of time debugging silly errors which I did a lot of last year.
