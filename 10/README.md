# Day 10

I'm not a fan of stack problems but I practiced them a lot for a job interview so they come easily to me. I again rushed the solution without fully reading the problem which cost me a lot of time

Part 2 was not significantly more difficult but I forgot how to reverse a string and I had some typos that cost me time. Getting wrong answers from typos meant I was in timeout jail a few times too
