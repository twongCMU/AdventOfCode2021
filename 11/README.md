# Day 11

I usually hate these kinds of problems but this one wasn't so bad. My part 1 was buggy because I misread the problem and thought that the flashes happened on 9 not higher than 9. It looks like others had trouble too as I still placed 770th despite my bugs

Part 2 was sad. What should have been a simple matter of raising the loop range turned into a huge mess because I accidentally reused a variable in two nested loops so even though it was correctly detecting the end condition it wasn't printing out the right loop iteration. It should have taken 30 seconds but instead I wasted almost 10 minutes on it. I've made this mistake in a previous week too so I should learn from this
