# Day 17

I enjoyed this problem but I was really bad at it. I just wrote a simulator that plotted the course of various shots until it it or missed the target. It wasn't sfficient but it worked.

Part 2 was really bad for me. For some reason I got it into my head that probe was being fired by an angle and a velocity rather than a delta X/delta Y. So, I had this mental block where the X value was between 0 and 90. This makes no sense given how the problem is explained and how I was implementing other parts of the code, but having X maxed at 90 meant I missed out on half of the solutions since X could be up to 202. It took me an hour and a hint from a friend to get over this mental block.

It was still an enjoyable problem but I'm unhappy that I did such a bad job of implementing it!
