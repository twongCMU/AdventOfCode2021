# Day 25

The final day! I had a solution coded up in about 10 minutes (which was too late for the leaderboard) but also my code didn't work. I was plagued by silly bugs again and it took 45 minutes total to get it working. It's a humbling reminder that despite my years of coding experience I can still be stymied by a myriad of badly written if statements.
