# Day 13

Ugh. I spent 27 minutes trying to build a numpy matrix with the data and folding it but it was all broken. I threw it all out and started over by only storing the relatively few points into a dict and iterating over it to fold. It was much easier to process mentally when organized this way and I had a solution in under 10 minutes after starting over (total almost 37 minutes)

Part 2 was not much harder than part 1 once I started over as I only had to add the other fold direction. It was silly converting from the dict of points to a numpy matrix for display but again it was easier to conceive mentally and that made the solution easier to implement. I was never able to debug the initial part 1 solution but after I threw it out and did it using a dict I did almost no debugging to get the right answers.

My overall score wasn't my best work but if I remove the 27 minutes I wasted doing it wrong, then my second attempt took about 10 minutes for each star which is a time I am content with.
